# Problem statement  
The richest 1% owns almost half of the world’s wealth and accounts for almost two-thirds of the world’s new wealth. As Percy Bysshe Shelley once said, "The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.”  This research project tackles the perplexing task of becoming wealthy and successful financially in the current economic climate. In addition to analyzing the societal ramifications of wealth distribution, it seeks to empower people and businesses in their pursuit of financial goals by offering data-driven insights, solutions, and financial literacy. Ultimately, it hopes to contribute to a fairer and more knowledgeable economic environment.  To test the null hypothesis of: “I will not become a billionaire in this lifetime” vs alternative hypothesis of, “I will become a billionaire in this lifetime.” 

# Metrics  

Some of the metrics that we used to measure results were demographic metrics such as the age distribution of billionaires and the gender distribution among billionaires.  For wealth and GDP metrics we used a comparison of total wealth of billionaires compared to the GDP among countries.  We also used a distribution of wealth by industry (tech, finance, retail, etc...), and the most common and frequent source of wealth.  For net worth metrics, we used the total net worth distribution and the top 10 countries with billionaires.
